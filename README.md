# Low Friction Elixir: Reimplementing *NIX tools

In this tutorial, I'd like to get you up and running with plain-vanilla
Elixir. We'll ignore all the extra tooling that comes bundled with the language
(mix, hex, exunit, etc.) and just focus on cloning the simple command-line
programs we all know and love.

In particular, we'll re-create the essential features of the following *NIX
tools:

- `true`
- `false`
- `echo`
- `yes`
- `cat`
- `grep`
- `wc`
- ...and time permitting: `curl`

We'll cover core language sytnax and semantics, and leverage the excellent
Elixir documentation available online (and in Dash/Zeal).

After the workshop, you should have the confidence to write small Elixir
scripts to scratch your little itches. From there, it should be easy to pick up
more involved bits of the Elixir ecosystem, as you see fit.


# Prerequisites

**You** have heard of Elixir and always wanted to try it, but don't feel like
writing web applications for fun. You won't have to! You have basic familiarity
with the *NIX shell environment.

**Your computer** has the following tools available: `elixir` (> 1.5.0), `bash`,
`true`, `false`, `cat`, `grep`, and `curl`. See [here][install-elixir] for
Elixir installation instructions.
